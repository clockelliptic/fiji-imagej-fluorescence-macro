Macro for Fiji (aka ImageJ) for automatically counting fluorescence.

Written in ImageJ's default/proprietary scripting language, based on Java.


This macro was written to help measure mycelial growth in P. stipticus 
cultures, but can be used for measuring the intensity of fluorescence in 
any cellular confocal microscopy dataset.


To use the macro, 
 1. open Fiji and go (Plugins -> Macros -> Edit) an open the macro file.
 2. change the filepath, filename, and n_images variables to fit your dataset.
 3. press run
 4. don't press anything until it finishes
 5. remember to save your results
 
 
 Follow along with the provided step-by-step walkthrough to learn how to do 
 what the macro does by hand. You can use the provided 'night_sky.gif' image 
 file to use Z-Project--to simulate reducing the dimensionality of a stack of 
 z-axis images.
